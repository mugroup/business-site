Well-known Huntman clients have included Sir Winston Churchill, King Edward VII, King Edward VIII, Ronald Reagan, &amp; Marc Jacobs.</p>
<p>Huntsman needed help to align their ecommerce store with their brick-and-mortar store. Day-to-day maintenance became a full-time job for the Huntsman team and they couldn&#8217;t implement new custom features on a whim. Funtalkingca stepped in and streamlined their processes using Salesforce and various other systems.</p>
<p>Testing their VIP club app manually and on all devices wouldn&#8217;t have made sense. Funtalkingca implemented an automated testing system for their app, allowing them to be assured the app is always up and running and delivering the desired response on all devices.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toshi is an e-commerce solution exclusively for the luxury fashion industry in central London. It integrates with the retailer’s existing e-commerce solution and allows them to optimise inventory, conversion to sales, customer experience, customer retention as well as to minimize returns. They do this by partnering with fashion retailers who want to offer a premium service whereby an assistant is sent to the customer within one hour or when the customer chooses to do a fitting. Upon checkout the Toshi system checks whether the customer falls within the range of the store, and if so, it will show Toshi as a delivery option. Toshi will also then show other sizes available and the customer can let the assistant bring those sizes along for fitting as well.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best new global Music Messaging Products and Apple’s Editor’s Choice in 13 countries. Funtalkingca helped to port the complex iOS version of MSTY for Android on a tight schedule. The UK-based company launched the app in 155 countries with a catalogue of 2,000 song clips, cut down to the most meaningful 30 seconds by humans rather than the computer algorithms that create previews on services such as iTunes. The songs are curated into playlists by mood or genre such as flirt, celebrate, sport, pop hits and seventies music. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSTY signed licensing deals with Universal, Sony and Warner before launching, giving it legal access to 22m songs – is also integrated with Apple Music. Users can click through from a song clip they are sent in the app to the album on Apple Music, where they are able to stream or purchase the song.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We built the entire back end for Bluubin, and most recently, the </span><b>user management system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This system includes automations such as event-triggered emails based on a user’s actions, for example, when a user signs up, when his profile is left empty after 7 days, how-to guides after 14 and 30 days etc. We also implemented a debit order integration with Nedbank and credit card integration with PayFast. In addition, we implemented automated solutions catered for more complex user management cases such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading a certain package of the software while simultaneously downgrading another part</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switching from arrears billing to billing in advance</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switching from monthly to annual billing </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous versions also included  payment based on certain usage parameters, for example, the number of transactions per customer in a given month, so a customer could receive a bill of R250 one month and automatically get an invoice of R2,500 the next month if the threshold of transactions were exceeded.</span></li>
